# VMTurbo Survey Results - Raw Data
#### 
In conjunction with our open surveys at VMTurbo, we are sharing the results to provide the community the ability to review the data directly. 

The first of our open surveys was our OpenStack Survey in June 2015 which was filled out by 1284 respondents.  The associated data is available here in .XLS format including all questions and full answer results from the survey.

Our follow on survey regarding network latency is also published here and can be downloaded in .XLSX format.
